Rob Pike just screaming his lungs out on stage!


Parallelism: Split the file or input into parts, feed each thread one part and put the results together at the end.
	- multiple tasks of the same program run at the same time, they are independent of each other
	- many units of computation are executing at the same time, on different cores

Concurrency: Multiple computations happening at the same time
	- multiple tasks are interleaved, onto one single CPU core, and they finish in overlapping time periods
	- pipelining is a great example of this, there is only one unit of computation executing at a given time, but units from different tasks are interleaved to execute together and come to completion together
